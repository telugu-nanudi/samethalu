#### Meaning in English:
O teacher, uktam! uktam !
Said by a school-boy when he saw a board about to fall on his master's head. He had been taught to render the Sanscrit word Uktam by Palaka baddadi ("it was said"). These words also signify " the board has fallen," which the boy took to be the correct meaning of the Sanscrit word.
