#### Proverb Meaning in English:
Any quantity of presents must suflice at a dead man's marriage.
When a marriage takes place, presents of cloths are sent to the bride and bridegroom by their relations. Return gifts of about equal value are made shortly after the marriage. Should the bridegroom, however, die during theceremonies, no presents are returned, and no complaints are therefore made regarding the value of those received.
