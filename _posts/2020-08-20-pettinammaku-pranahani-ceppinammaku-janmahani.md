#### Meaning in English:
She that gives will lose her life, she that advised will lose [the advantage of] her birth.
The story runs thus: In the city of Matipuram, dwelt a king named Nayasali. He had three wives named Sumedah, Suvarchala, and Nitimati. Sumedah was blessed with a son; her rival wives, being barren, were less loved by the king. This caused them to be jealous of Surmedah, and Nitimati counselled Suvarchala to poison the son, saying that afterwards they would share the king's favor equally with their more fortunate rival. Suvarchala consulted in the matter with her intimate friend Vichitravati,the minister's daughter: Vichitravati after some deliberation replied " She that gives will lose her life, she that advised will lose her birth" (i.e. will be banished from the king's presence.) Suvarchala profiting by her friend's advice and perceiving the fatal consequences which would follow the commission of the intended crime, desisted from her wicked purpose.
