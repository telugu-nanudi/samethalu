#### Meaning in English:
Your fate is under the Banyan tree at Villuru.
( See No. 1980. )
A certain king consulting on one occasion an astrologer was told that he would in two years be hanged as a thief on the western bough of the Banyan tree at Villuru. The king laughed at this but the astrologer only replied "Your fate is under the Banyan tree at Villuru." The king afterwards believing his predictions, went far away to the Himalayas and there having caused himself to be maimed so that he could not walk, practised penance. At the expiration of the two years, Yama the god of death suddenly came and mounted the unfortunate king on a horse which flew with him through the air, and threw him under the Banyan tree at Villuru. The same night a band of robbers having plundered a Raja's palace brought their booty and divided it under the Banyan tree. The doomed king enquired from them where he was, and having learnt to his dismay that he was at Villuru, and on the western side of the tree, he crawled round with difficulty to the eastern side. There he was found by the Raja's men, and beside him a jewel which the robbers had accidently left behind them. In vain he pleaded innocence. The Raja was informed that one of the robbers had been found, the jewel was identified, and the unfortunate king was hanged on the eastern bough. Immediately this was done the tree turned round and the astrologer's prediction was fulfilled.
This story is told as a wonderful instance of the power of fate.
He that is born to be hanged shall never be drowned.
What will be, will be. (Italian)[1]
