#### Meaning in English:
[Like a widow saying] "if he were alive, he would at least call the barber."
This is a reproach to the husband as being a useless fellow only fit to be employed as a messenger, and is also a joke, as the widow only, and not the wife, requires the services of a barber, to shave her head.

#### Meaning in Telugu:
అతడు వుంటే మంగలివాణ్ని అయినా  పిలుచును.

#### Romanization:
Ataḍu vuṇṭē maṅgalivāṇni ayinā  pilucunu.
