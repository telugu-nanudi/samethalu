#### Proverb Meaning in English:
The inhabitant of the village is afraid of the cemetery; the stranger is afraid of the water. The inhabitant of the village has a superstitious dread of the burial or burning ground, and avoids it; but the stranger does not know its situation and walks through it. On the other hand, the villager knows the depth of the tank, and does not fear going into it, but the stranger is afraid to venture.
No safe wading in an unknown water.
