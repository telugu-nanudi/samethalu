#### Meaning in English:
A man that counts the rafters of his benefactor's house.
A story is told of a man who counted the rafters, &c., of a house in order that he might take possession of it and found his claim to it on this knowledge. Hence the term is applied to a person basely attempting to swindle another, who had befriended him, out of his property.
(See Nos. 267, 636, 685, 1077, 1078, 1250.)
All's lost that's put into a riven dish.
