#### Meaning in English:
There is no relation like your turband, there is no scamp equal to your jacket.
A turband can be tied so as to hide all holes, which is not the case with the jacket; the turband is therefore likened to a trustworthy friend, and the jacket to an unfaithful fellow.

#### Meaning in Telugu:
పాగావంటి బంధువుడూ లేడు, అంగరకావంటి హరాంఖోరూ లేడు.

#### English Transliteration:
