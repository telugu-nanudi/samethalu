#### Meaning in English:
The brinjal gardener is blind, though he sees; the betel gardener is deaf, though he hears.
( For Brinjal use No. 97. -- See No. 1278.)
In the first case, the gardener on being asked to give brinjals pretends he cannot find any; in the second case, the gardener when called to by some one outside the garden for betel pretends he cannot hear.--(Brahmans and some high caste Sudras are forbidden by their Sastras to enter a betel garden).
None so deaf as he that won't hear. (French.)[2]
