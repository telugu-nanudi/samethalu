#### Meaning in English:
My half areca nut is in the ship, brother!
A merchant was returning to his country in a ship which he had laden with areca-nuts. A friend on board cunningly dropped half of a nut which he was eating into the hold, exclaiming " My half nut is in the ship, brother!" The merchant laughing replied that he would restore it, on which the other, pretending to carry on the joke, made him give a bond to the effect that his half areca-nut was in the ship. The phrase also could be construed as meaning that half the areca-nuts in the ship were his. On arriving at their destination the merchant was prosecuted by the swindler and cheated out of half his cargo.
Said of a clever cheat.

#### Meaning in Telugu:
