#### Proverb Meaning in English:
The bear is witness for the bloodsucker or
The hedge is witness for the bloodsucker.
(For Tonda see No. 1121.)
According to the first interpretation, a band of Mahomedan freebooters, when seeking on one occasion to discover treasure which had been buried by the inhabitants of a plundered village, having perceived first a chameleon nodding on certain spots and afterwards a bear sniffing in the same places, spent much labour in digging up the earth, but all in vain.---The application is that natural habits are not to be taken notice of.
According to others, the hedge where the chameleon lives should be questioned as to the latter's veracity and character,---the application being that the evidence of one man should be corroborated by that of another.
Ask my chum if I am a thief. (Italian)[1]
