#### Proverb Meaning in English:
The sin which a man commits goes with his body, the sin which his mother commits goes with the earth.
This is interpreted to mean that if a man commits the sin of adultery, his crime may be expiated by a punishment equal to loss of life, but if a woman is guilty of the same offence, it clings to her descendants as long as the world endures.

#### Proverb Meaning in Telugu:
