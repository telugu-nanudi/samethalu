#### Meaning in English:
The envious Reddi ruined the village while living, and was a curse to it when dead.
A Reddi who had oppressed the people of his village all his life, requested them, when dying, to burn his body in a certain spot. This they willingly acceded to, and took the Reddi's corpse there for that purpose, when they were attacked by the inhabitants of the neighbouring village, within the limit of which the Reddi had desired to be burned, and this became an everlasting cause of contention. (See Tatachari's Tales Page 5.)
