#### Meaning in English:
The gardener knows the taste of the brinjal; the king knows the taste of the plantain.
( For Brinjal see No. 97.)
Brinjals should be cooked and eaten fresh from the garden. Plantains when used in an unripe state as a vegetable, should be kept a few days. Before the brinjals are set before a king they have lost some of their flavour, and as the gardener cannot afford to keep the plantains he plucks, he cooks them before they are ready for the pot.

#### Meaning in Telugu:

#### English Transliteration:
