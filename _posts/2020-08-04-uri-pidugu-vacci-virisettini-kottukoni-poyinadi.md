#### Meaning in English:
The misfortune of the village has carried off Virisetti.
The story is as follows: A burglar in digging through the wall of a house was killed by the wall falling upon him; his wife prosecuted the owner of the house for having badly built walls; the house owner blamed the builder; the builder blamed a woman who had distracted his attention while at his work, by passing by that way; the woman blamed a goldsmith to whom she was going to get certain jewels which he had not finished for her; the goldsmith blamed the banker for not letting him have gold in time; the banker was sentenced accordingly to be impaled, but on the point of being put to death he suggested that the size of the instruments would be much better suited to fat Virisetti (to whom he owed a grudge); fat Virisetti was executed accordingly. This happened at Anyayapura (the city of injustice.)
The innocent sutfering for the guilty.
