#### Proverb Meaning in English:
There is no yawn without a wonder
Prataparudrudu king of orugallu, (Warrangal) had a very sagacious minister, by name Yugandharudu, who was summoned by the Sultan to be employed in his court. The king refusing to send him, was taken prisoner and confined in the capital. His faithful minister having declared that he would rescue him and bring him back openly, went disguised to the capital and there feigning madness, ran daily through the streets calling out " Ho! I am going to take away oruganti Prataparudrudu." The Sultan, suspecting that his madness was assumed, caused him to be watched. The spies discovered that he cooked under a tree at midnight, and a man was concealed in the tree to watch him when he thought himself alone. According to his custom the minister came at midnight to cook his food, and while doing so, yawned. He immediately thought to himself that there must be some cause for this, and glancing furtively up the tree perceived the spy. He then said in a loud voice 'There is no yawn without a wonder,' and commenced breaking his pots and acting the mad man. The minister was then reported as really mad and his ravings were unheeded. Shortly afterwards a ship laden with valuables, was sent by the minister's contrivance to the port. The Sultan hearing this, was anxious to inspect the cargo, and being informed that the imprisoned king was a connoisseur in gems ordered him to be brought with him on board the vessel. The minister also managed to get on board and while The the Sultan was engaged in examining the precious stones, caused the anchor to be weighed. The Sultan then learnt the trick that had been played upon him and commending the sagacity of the minister, pardoned both him and the king, who returned rejoicing to orugallu.[1]
