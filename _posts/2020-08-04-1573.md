#### Meaning in English:
"A near relation has come," said he "stoop and pluck the betel leaves."
The owner of the garden unwillingly complied with his relation's demand to be supplied with betel leaf gratis, and instructed his gardener with the ambiguous phrase " stoop and pinch," which the relation understood to mean that the order was to be obeyed with alacrity, the object really being that the worst leaves, which are always nearest the ground, should be given. The word translated " near" signifies literally " one who goes not."
Applied to that which is done because politeness requires it, but unwillingly.
