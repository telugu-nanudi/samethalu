#### Proverb Meaning in English:
The whole people [of the earth], the sage Agastya, and his jar are all of equal weight.
The legend is that when all the great men of the earth had, on one occasion, assembled at Kaihtsa, their weight was so great that the earth began to topple over. On this, Agsstya was sent to weigh down the other side which he accordingly did, but his presence being afterwards required at Kailasa, he transferred his virtue to his jar of holy waters, left it to balance the earth, and obeyed the summons.
